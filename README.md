L3-Static-Router
================
* Problem Statement : https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Simple-Router
* In this project, Router with a static routing table in Mininet is implemented. It processes received Ethernet frames just like a real router, then forwards them to the correct outgoing interface. 
ARP cache, LPM, Routing, ICMP packet handling modules are implemented.

#### Refer `router/sr_router.c[.h]` as a starting point for the Router's logic.
